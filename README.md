COB Admin
=========

An automation system, which will help system administrators to manage their server in a easy way. COB Admin is built on django framework, and will be available in different modules.

Modules
-------

* dns: a complete authoritative server administration, using a database as the backend. As the authoritative name server, PowerDNS will be easy to port. I will work as a versioning control, based on the serials, that will be able to see the difference between the serials, and even going back to the serials.
* cmdb: a configuration management database module
* any other ideia
